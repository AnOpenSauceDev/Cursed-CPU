# Cursed-CPU

Cursed CPU implementation (it _can_ do "Hello World!")
Comes with a whopping 256 bytes of RAM, 7 instructions, and ~~5~~ 4 general-purpose registers!

I didn't look at other people's implementations so I could become more knowledgeable about low-level programming.

Currently this is V1. V2 will be a far better CPU design, as i was just coding as i went with this.

Currently working on V1.5, with far better programming standards, magic addresses, and more!

Please do not look at this atrocity, it's ugly and i can't be bothered to polish it yet with switch statements, masking, headers and so on.

requires ncurses-dev, and is kinda broken as of now (thanks, ncurses). Once V2 is done, it will run a minimal POSIX-compliant OS.
